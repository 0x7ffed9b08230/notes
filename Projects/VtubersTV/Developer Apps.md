A system like Discord to make Developer Applications (Bots) to act like normal users, except there would be limits to these bots.

## Limits

- Developer's can't have more than 4 bots at a time
- Bots **MUST** comply with the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
- Bots will have stricter upload limits like time to upload and file size
